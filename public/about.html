  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr>
  
  <p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm an aspiring web developer who's passionate about building simple, clean, and user-friendly websites. I recently started my journey into the world of web development and I'm excited to keep learning and growing in this field.</p>
  
  <p>So far, I've created a few fun projects like a Movie Ranking site and a Birthday Invite page using HTML. This portfolio is a way for me to track my progress and showcase what I've built as I learn more about web design and development.</p>
  
  <p>When I'm not coding, you can probably find me listening to music, gaming, or exploring new things online. I'm always up for a good challenge and love solving problems, whether it's in code or life.</p>

  <p>Thanks for stopping byâ€”feel free to check out the rest of my work!</p>
